        <item display="" display1="" id="1" comparision="On life's journey faith is nourishment, virtuous deeds are a shelter, wisdom is the light by day and right mindfulness is the protection by night. If a man lives a pure life, nothing can destroy him."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="2" comparision="The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science.

In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men."/>
