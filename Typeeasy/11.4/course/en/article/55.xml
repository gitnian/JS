        <item display="" display1="" id="1" comparision="Spud, that was her name. It said so in black ink on the strip of adhesive tape stuck to front of her pink and white checked shirt. Spud. I had just rolled over a little girl named Spud."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="2" comparision="I was backing the car, this old Sport about wagon. The car picked up speed, the brakes couldn't slow it down, and the back window was so fogged I couldn't see anything. The car kept going faster and I did it. I rolled over something. It felt like squash, something starting to rot. Then the car stopped."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="3" comparision="He came running up to the car, this man with the little girl in his arms. He looked Japanese, but I wasn't sure. He said nothing, not a word, but he had this look on his face. He wanted to cry and he wanted to kill me. I don't blame him."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="4" comparision="He brought the girl to the driver's door. But I wouldn't open it. I reached back to the door behind me, unlocking it. I didn't want him to place the girl in my lap. No, anything but that."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="5" comparision="That's when I saw her name. He placed her on the back seat. And I saw it. Spud, it said. She was blond, five or six years old. Maybe this man had adopted her, or maybe he was simply looking out for her today."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="6" comparision="In his hand, I could see he held something. Something for the little girl? No, a can of mace. He sprayed me in the face. I knew he had to."/>
