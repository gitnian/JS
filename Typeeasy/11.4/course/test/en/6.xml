        <item display="" display1="" id="0" comparision="Yesterday a man was sucked out of an airplane over the blue tipped mountains of Bolivia. He didn't cry &quot;emergency.&quot; He didn't buzz the stewardess. He just dropped his fork, opened his mouth, and let the wind gather him inch by inch."/>
        <item display="" display1="" id="1" comparision="The other passengers agreed. This was real life, better than the movie or chicken salad. They leaned out of their seats, envying the man, arms and legs spread like a sheet, discovering raw air and the breath of migrating angels."/>
